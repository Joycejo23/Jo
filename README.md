AIM:
To Install Git And Creating Repositories.

DESCRIPTION:
GIT: Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.
GITHUB: GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
REPOSITORY: Repository is the most basic element of GitHub. 
It’s a place where you can store your code,your files,and revision history.
Repositories can have multiple collaborators and be either private or public.

STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
Double-click the executable you just downloaded, then click "Next" to move through the
installation prompts.
The first is the text editor Git will use. The default selection is Vim. Vim is ubiquitous and a
hallmark of command-line interfaces everywhere but learning to use its idiosyncratic
commands can be daunting. You should probably pick something else instead, like Visual
Studio Code, Sublime, NotePad++, or any other plain text editor you like.
The second is the way Git integrates itself into your PC's PATH. Make sure that the "Git
From The Command Line And Also From 3rd-Party Software" is selected.
Click through the remaining options, and wait for everything to finish downloading. The time
requires to download everything will vary depending on what you chose to install. The default
selection results in a download that is about 270 megabytes.

MANAGING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC REPOSITORY
MAKING A REPOSITORY PRIVATE:
• GitHub will detach public forks of the public repository and put them into a new
network. Public forks are not made private.
• If you're using GitHub Free for personal accounts or organizations, some features won't
be available in the repository after you change the visibility to private. Any published
GitHub Pages site will be automatically unpublished. If you added a custom domain to
the GitHub Pages site, you should remove or update your DNS records before making
the repository private, to avoid the risk of a domain takeover.
• GitHub will no longer include the repository in the GitHub Archive Program.
• GitHub Advanced Security features, such as code scanning, will stop working.
MAKING A REPOSITORY PUBLIC:
• GitHub will detach private forks and turn them into a standalone private repository.
• If you're converting your private repository to a public repository as part of a move
toward creating an open source project.
• Once your repository is public, you can also view your repository's community profile
to see whether your project meets best practices for supporting contributors.
• The repository will automatically gain access to GitHub Advanced Security features.
Changing a repository’s Visibility
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select
the dropdown menu, then click Settings.
3. In the "Danger Zone" section, to the right of to "Change repository visibility",
click Change visibility.
4. Select a visibility.
5. To verify that you're changing the correct repository's visibility,
6. type the name of the repository you want to change the visibility of.
7. Click I understand, change repository visibility.
OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS:
RESULT
Installation Of Git And Creating Repositories Is Done Successfully

2.ex
Aim:
To set up and configure Git on your local machine, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Install Git
- Download the Git installer from the official Git website.
- Run the installer and follow the step-by-step instructions in the setup wizard.
- Make sure to select the appropriate options during the installation process.
Step 2: Configure Git
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Set your username and email address by running the following commands:
-  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Replace "Your Name" with your desired username and "your.email@example.com" with your email address.
Step 3: Set up the default branch name (optional)
- By default, Git creates a branch called "master" when you initialize a new repository with
git init.
- If you prefer to use a different name for the initial branch,
- you can set it using the following command:
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
This command sets the default branch name to "main".
Replace "main" with your preferred branch name if desired.
6
Step 4: Verify your Git configuration
- To check your Git configuration settings, you can use the following command:
git config --list
This command will display a list of your Git configuration settings,
including your username and email address.
These steps should help you set up and configure Git on your local machine.
Remember to replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your own information.
Working with Remote Repository
When working with remote repositories in Git,
there are several commands and actions you can perform.
7
Cloning a Remote Repository
The git clone command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.
To clone a remote repository, use the following command git clone <remote-url>
Replace <remote-url> with the URL of the remote repository.
For example, to clone a repository hosted on GitHub, you can use
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git Adding a Remote Repository
If you have an existing local repository and want to connect it to a remote repository,
you can use the git remote add command. To add a remote repository, use the following command:
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
Replace <remote-name> with a name for the remote repository (e.g., "origin") and
<remote-url> with the URL of the remote repository. For example
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository
After making changes to your local repository,
 you can push those changes to the remote repository using the git push command.
To push changes to a remote repository, use the following command:
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
Replace <remote-name> with the name of the remote repository (e.g., "origin") and
<branch- name> with the name of the branch you want to push. For example:
git push origin main
8
Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository
To update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository,
you can use the git pull command. To pull changes from a remote repository, use the following command:
git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
Replace <remote-name> with the name of the remote repository (e.g.,
"origin") and <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to pull. For example
git pull origin main
These are some basic commands for working with remote repositories in Git.
Remember to replace <remote-url>, <remote-name> and
<branch-name> with the appropriate values for your specific repository.
Result:
Working with a remote repositories on local machine was accomplished successfully

3.ex
Aim:
To set up and configure Git on your local machine.
Version Control System:
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording 
changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
Types of Version Control Systems:
• Local Version Control Systems
• Centralized Version Control Systems
• Distributed Version Control Systems
Three important steps of version control:
•git add changed files to version control tracking.
•git commit the changed files to create a unique snapshot of the local repository.
•git push those changed files from the local copy of a repository to the cloud
Check the Status of Changes Using GIT Status
Once you start working, you can use the git status command to
check what changes are being identified by git.
To practice working with this command, 
use the terminal to navigate to your git practice repository:
$ cd practice-git-skillz Next, run git status. $ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.nothing to commit, working tree clean
23CS2503 - Git and Github for beginners Lab URK23CS5076
8
Notice that when you run git status it returns: working tree clean. 
This means that there are no changes to any files in your repo - YET.
Next, open and make a small change to the README.md file in a text editor. 
Then, run the command git status to check that changes have been made to your file(s).
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.Changes not staged for commit:
modified: README.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
The output from the git status command above indicates that you have modified a file 
(e.g. README.md) that can be added to version control.
Important Git Commands
These two commands make up the bulk of many workflows that use git for version control:
•git add: takes a modified file in your working directory and 
places the modified version in a staging area for review.
•git commit: takes everything from the staging area and makes a 
permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that has a unique identifier.
Add Changed Files Using git add
After making changes, you can add either an individual control tracking. 
To add a single file, run the command: git add file-name.extension
For example, to add the README.md file, you would use:
git add README.md
You can also add all of the files that you have edited at the same time using: git add .
Commit Changed Files Using git commit
Once you are ready to make a snapshot of the current state of your repository
(i.e. move changes from staging area), you can run git commit. 
The git commit command requires a commit message that describes the snapshot 
(i.e. changes) that you made in that commit.
A commit message should outline what changed and why. 
These messages:
1. help collaborators and your future self understand what was changed and why.
23CS2503 - Git and Github for beginners Lab URK23CS5076
9
2. allow you and your collaborators to find (and undo if necessary) changes that were previously made.
When you are not committing a lot of changes, you can create a
short one line commit message using the -m flag as follows:
git commit -m "Update title and author name in homework for week 3" modified:
README.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
The output from the git status command above indicates that
you have modified a file (e.g. README.md) that can be added to version control.
file or groups of files to version

Creating branches
To keep track of changes to this file using git, you need to:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Move into the cloned repository
3. Create a new branch using the command (replace feature-branch with your desired branch name).
4. git checkout -b feature-branch
5. Make modifications to files in your project.
6. Use git add to add the changes to the staging area
7. Commit the changes with a meaningful message
8. 
Merging branches
To keep track of changes to this file using git, you need to:
1. Switch back to the main branch.
git checkout main
2. Merge the branch into the main branch git merge feature-branch
3. Resolve conflicts (if necessary)
i. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts manually. ii.
After resolving conflicts, add the changes to the staging area and commit: git add . git commit
-m "Merge feature-branch into main"
5. Push changes to github using the following command. git push origin main

Aim:
The aim of this exercise is to learn and understand how to work with collaborative repository management using git.
Working with collaborative repository management using Git involves collaborating with 
other developers and effectively managing changes to a shared codebase.
Here are some key practices and concepts to consider:

Forking a Repository
-
When you want to contribute to a project hosted on a remote repository, 
it's common to start by forking the repository.
-
Forking creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account or another hosting platform,
where you can freely make changes without affecting the original repository.
-
To fork a repository on GitHub, navigate to the repository's page and click the "Fork" button.
Cloning a Forked Repository
-
After forking a repository, you need to clone the forked repository to your local machine to start making changes.
-
Use the git clone command, as explained in a previous answer, to clone the forked repository.
Adding an Upstream Remote
-
The original repository that you forked is known as the "upstream" repository. 
It represents the source of truth for the project.
-
To synchronize your forked repository with the latest changes from the upstream repository,
you can add an "upstream" remote.
-
Use the git remote add command to add the upstream remote URL. For example:
git remote add upstream <upstream-url>
Keeping Your Forked Repository Up to Date
-
To incorporate the latest changes from the upstream repository into your forked repository, 
follow these steps:
-
Fetch the latest changes from the upstream remote: git fetch upstream
-
Checkout your local main branch: git checkout main
-
Merge the changes from the upstream/main branch into your
local main branch: git merge upstream/main
-
Push the updated main branch to your forked repository: git push origin main
Creating Branches for Collaborative Work
-
When working on a collaborative project, 
it's common to create branches for new features, bug fixes, or other changes.
-
Use the git branch command to create a new branch: git branch <branch- name>
-
Switch to the newly created branch using git checkout: `git checkout
<branch-name>`
-
Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in one command: git checkout -b <branch-name>
Pushing Changes and Creating Pull Requests
-
Once you've made changes on a branch, 
you can push the branch to your forked repository using git push origin <branch-name>.
-
After pushing the branch, 
you can create a pull request on the upstream repository to
propose your changes for merging into the main codebase.
-
On the upstream repository's page, find the "Pull requests" section and click the "New pull request" button.
-
Select the appropriate branches for the base (usually main) and compare (your branch) branches.
-
Provide a title and description for your pull request,
then click "Create pull request" to submit it.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests
-
Collaborators or maintainers of the upstream repository 
can review and comment on your pull request.
-
They may request changes or provide feedback before merging the changes.
-
Once the pull request is approved, 
it can be merged into the main branch of the upstream repository.

Result:
Working with collaborative repository management using git is done and executed successfully.

Aim The aim of this experiment is to create implementation of core review in git

Description
Git is a powerful tool for version control, 
but it’s also a crucial tool for collaborating with remote
teams.
When working remotely, effective communication and collaboration arekey to ensure that
your team is working together towards a common goal.
Use a shared repository Using a shared repository is the foundation of effective collaboration
with Git. 
By hosting your repository on a remote server, 
you can give your team members access
to the latest version of your code, regardless of their location.
Create a new repository: git init
Clone a repository: git clone [respository URL]
Add a remote repository: git remote add [name] [repository URL]
Fetch changes from a remote repository: git fetchPull
changes from a remote repository: git pull Push
changes to a remote repository: git push Use
Branching and merging Branching and merging are powerful features of Git that allow you to
work on multiple versions of your code simultaneously, 
without interfering with each other’s
work. By using branching and merging effectively,
your team can work on different features or
bug fixes in parallel, without causing conflicts.
Create a new branch: git branch [name]Switch
to a branch: git checkout [name]Merge a
branch: git merge [name] Resolve merge
conflicts: git mergetool Delete a branch: git
Ex. No. 6 IMPLEMENTATION OF CORE REVIEW IN GIT
Date:02.04.2024

URK23CS5076

branch -d [name]
Use Pull requests Pull requests are a great way to review and merge changes from differentteam
members before they are merged into the main codebase. 
By using pull requests, you can ensure
that your code is reviewed and tested before it is merged into the main branch, 
which can help
prevent bugs and other issues.
Create a new pull request: git request-pull [branch] [repository URL]
Review and merge a pull request: git pull-request
Close a pull request: git request-pull -C [branch] [repository URL]
Use Issue Tracking Issue tracking is a great way to keep track of bugs, 
feature requests, and
other issues that need to be addressed in your code.
By using an issue tracking system like
GitHub Issues, you can assign tasks to team members, 
track progress, and ensure that all issues
are addressed in a timely manner.
Create a new issue: git commit -m “[issue number] [commit message]”
Assign an issue to a team member: git assign [username]
Clone an issue: git clone [issue number] Reopen an
issue: git reopen [issue number] Communicate
Effectively Effective communication is key to collaboration, 
especially in a remote team setting.
Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to stay in touch with your team members, 
and use video
calls or screen sharing to discuss code changes or work on problems together.
Start a video call: git video-call [username]
Share yourscreen: gitscreen-share
Send a message: git message [username] [message]
Use Git hooks Git hooks are scripts that Git runs automatically at certain points in the
Gitworkflow. You can use Git hooks to automate repetitive tasks, 
enforce coding standards, or
perform other tasks that are important to your team’s workflow.
Install a git hook: git init [hook name]
Write a git hook script: nano.git/hooks/[hook name]

Make the Git hook script executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/[hook name]
Use Gitsubmodules Git submodules are repositories that are embedded inside other repositories.
You can use Git submodules to manage dependencies, 
or to includeshared code in multiple
projects.
Add a Git submodule: git submodule add [repository URL]
Update a Gitsubmodule: gitsubmodule update
Remove a Gitsubmodule: gitsubmodule deinit [submodule path]
Use Git aliases Git aliases are shortcuts for commonly used Git commands.
You can useGit
aliases to save time and improve your productivity when working with Git.
Set up a Git alias: git config –global alias.[alias name] ‘[Git command]’
Use a Git alias: git [alias name]
